# kurz vor acht – German Pebble Watchface

This is is a watchface for the Pebble smartwatch that shows the current time in German.
The watchface is based on [n3v3rstextone](https://github.com/n3v3r001/n3v3rstextone) by [@n3v3r001](https://github.com/n3v3r001) and [Deutsch](https://github.com/wolframroesler/Deutsch) by [@wolframroesler](https://github.com/wolframroesler), adjusted for modern pebbles while keeping compatibility with the originals.

The time is shown in colloquial, "fuzzy" mode: We say "kurz vor acht" ("just before eight") e.g. when it's 7:58, but an exact mode is also available.

Several color themes are available (selected with the configuration dialog in your phone's Pebble app).

## Installation

### [Pebble Appstore](https://apps.repebble.com/4151feede8864a94905355d0)

### Sideloading
To install the watchface on your Pebble, download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page and upload the generated `kurz-vor-acht.pbw` file using the Pebble app on your smartphone. If you prefer building it yourself, you can also build and install the watchface with the [Pebble SDK](https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/). Also check out the devcontainer and GitHub Actions setup in this repo to see how to install the SDK and build the watchface.

Releases are built automatically in GitHub Actions, so the latest packaged build is always available from the repository's Releases page.
